'''Search Insert Position

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the 
target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2'''

def searchInsert( nums, target):

        low = 0
        high = len(nums) - 1

        while low <= high:

            mid = low + (high - low) // 2

            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid

            elif nums[mid] > target:
                high = mid - 1

            else:
                low = mid + 1

        return low
    
nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]
target = 2

print(searchInsert(nums, target))
