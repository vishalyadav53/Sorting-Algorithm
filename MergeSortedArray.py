'''88. Merge Sorted Array

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two 
integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside 
the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements 
denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored.
nums2 has a length of n.
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.'''

        indx1 = m - 1
        indx2 = n - 1
        indx3 = m + n - 1

        while indx2 >= 0:

                nums1[indx3] = nums1[indx1]
